The lifecycle of LLMs development and deployment encompasses both training and serving phases. Although training takes months and consumes significant amounts of energy, recent studies show that the energy consumption of LLM serving has now surpassed that of training, leading to significant environmental impacts, especially in terms of carbon footprints. While much prior work has focused on improving LLM performance, the specific challenge of reducing the carbon footprint of LLM serving has been largely overlooked. This paper identifies key challenges and outlines research directions for making LLM serving more sustainable, aiming to inspire further environmentally responsible advancements in the field.},

Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science.},
